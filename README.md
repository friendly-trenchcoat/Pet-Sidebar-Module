Even for inactive pets, stats are kept updated as you navigate the site.

In interactive mode, the slider stays open as you hover over it, and Books and Petpet links are added. This is configurable in the settings panel.


### Pet Naviation
Hover on the left of a pet image to expose pet Quick Links.

### Removing Pets from the Sidebar Module
When the settings panel is open, remove buttons appear over each pet.

When a pet is removed, it is added to a dropdown in the settings panel. You can add the pet back to the sidebar with the +, or delete the pet's data entirely with the trashcan.

If you still own a pet, the deleted data will be re-added upon visiting Quick Ref.

You can also easily clear all pet data in the settings panel, which is an easy first troubleshooting step if you encounter any issues.
